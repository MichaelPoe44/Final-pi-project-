Our Project intends to combine a graphical keypad and a camera to a secure a box or Safe. It intends to use to camera to search for faces in front of it and match them to faces stored
in a database of users who have access to it. This project uses hashing to make our password more stronger if someone knows about the password they will only know about the hashed 
password, they can't figure out the original password.
